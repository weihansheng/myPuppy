Simon loves to play, is a bit of a busy body and just needs to be somewhere where he can use his smarts and energy everyday. Unfortunately, we are unable to fulfill Simon\u0027s needs right now... Simon is NOT doing well here in the shelter. When Simon came to us he was a big goofball, unfortunately the stresses of being in a shelter environment for an extended period of time are proving to be too much for him. \nSimon has developed some undesirable behaviors. HOWEVER, we firmly believe that outside the shelter setting, these behaviors would significantly improve. Simon is not a bad boy, he is just trying to cope with his current situation the best way he knows how. \n\nSimon is looking for an adoptive home or foster home with an experienced owner, with no small animals and no children . He needs consistency and patience. \n\n**Please understand Simon is a special case and is looking for a dog experienced home that will give him the time, energy and patience (that\u0027s a big one) needed to correct his bad behaviors** \nAgain, he is NOT a bad boy, he is just reacting badly to his situation.\nIf you can help Simon become the best version of himself please fill out an application so we may set up a meet and greet!",

        "description": "Meet Miss Thea Queen! This beautiful girl has been with us at Wanderer\u0027s for quite some time now, and by \u0022quite some time we mean she just passed 400 days as being a resident here at the shelter. \nWhy? Well, that\u0027s a great question with a complex answer. \nLike MOST dogs Thea is absolutely terrified, which more then likely is presented as aggression when inside her kennel. The primary reason for this is because her kennel is HER HOME. She is a young dog whose life prior to the shelter we have no knowledge of; meaning for all we know she could have escaped an inadequate living environment, OR she could have possibly had a great home. We\u0027ll never know, but that\u0027s okay!\nWith the being said, imagine being in a foreign place, your new living quarters doesn\u0027t have windows and only one way out that\u0027s locked and requires thumbs to open (now imagine being a dog for that part). Then imagine having to use the restroom but being unable to actually use the restroom. That\u0027s what it\u0027s like in the minds of most shelter dogs, you\u0027d be a wreck too. Even though Thea is a Queen she can be a bit dramatic when meeting new people. Initially she can become defensive, definitely scared, and she\u0027ll even cower in the back end of her kennel. Maybe she\u0027ll let out a bark or 4 that doesn\u0027t show you who she actually is, what she\u0027s saying is \u0022HEY! The Queen doesn\u0027t know you!!! \nOur Thea here has required a bit of work to get her to where she is right now, we couldn\u0027t be more proud of her and how far she\u0027s come! After spending lots and lots of quality time with Thea we\u0027ve learned so many wonderful things about her that truly did shock us! She is STRONG, but eager with a secret submissive side. She just absolutely loves laying out in the grass, all splayed out like a frog, you can truly see the happiness in her facial expression and the bliss in her eyes, it\u0027s truly a sight to see. Another fan favorite of Theas is WATER, she could spend all day in the kiddy pools, she\u0027ll wade in the water and even lay in it for an impressive amount of time too. It usually takes place after she\u0027s had an intense tug-o-war match, or fetch! She fancy\u0027s both, but her absolute favorite toys are squeaky stuffed animals, any species she doesn\u0027t have a preference, as long as she can rip it to shreds and show them who the real Queen is she\u0027s happy. You\u0027d think she would have slipped a disk or given herself whiplash with how intensely she shakes her head back and forth.\nTheas adopter is required to continue her current obedience training. They\u0027ll need to have a very clear understanding of what it takes to properly care for her. Consistency is key for Theas success. It\u0027s highly suggested that her new owner is a single male, Thea responds impressively well to the depth of a mans voice and seemed to start obeying commands much quicker opposed to female handlers. Although it\u0027s not impossible for a women to gain her trust. \nGetting to know Thea will also require and consist of multiple visits to the shelter to guarantee a perfect fit. Thea is full of excitement and enthusiasm for every possible adventure! Will you be joining our Queen as her King? Guess you\u0027ll have to come and meet her for yourself! By appointment only, of course, being royalty and all.",

As soon as you meet her in her kennel she gives you the sweet eyes and loves to be loved. Polly\u2019s favorite thing to do is lay on the couch and cuddle. This sweet girl has a broken tail that is so cute when she wiggles it. She absolutely love car rides. A sweet as this girl is I\u2019m so surprised she hasn\u2019t found her forever home. \n\nShe is good with kids but recommend kids 8 years old or older. She has been around a 2 year old and will just give kisses. Just little kids energy she avoids. \n\nCats no \n\nOther dogs ok but will need a meet and greet.\n\nPolly is up to date on shots, microchipped and spayed",

She is looking for an experience owner as she still has a few corks to work out as she nips a little and wants to play tug a war with the leash but once on a walk she walk perfect with no pulling. She is very treat drivin and listens very well. \n\nBetty will sit and give paw. Her favorite is belly rubs or wiggling back and forth on her back. She is very affectionate and very happy girl. \n\nI personally went to FL and pulled her off the euthanized list as just cuz she didn\u2019t have any manner her time was up. Within the short time of having her she has completely became the happy love bug herself. \n\nOther dogs- ok if they are very playful but still would require a meet and greet \n\nKids- I recommend over 13. Due to size and playfulness \n\nCats- NO \n\nBetty is spayed, up to date on shots, HW negative and microchipped",

        "description": "Thank you for choosing rescue.  To begin the process please fill out an application here:  http:\/\/goo.gl\/forms\/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2\n\nThis is my foster dog...if you or anyone you know is interested in adopting this dog please contact: www.DogGoneInn.com\n\nName: \t\tHunter \nGender: \tNeutered \nColor:\t\tBrown\/White\nDOB:\t\t07\/02\/2020\nBreed:\t\tGermen Shepherd Dog\/ Siberian Husky Mix\nNotes:     I need a home without children, due to the abuse I have suffered in my life.  I am hand shy and will take a moment to warm up to you, but once I do, I am very sweet!  \n\nThere is an adoption process along with a donation.\n\nPlease bring your dog (if you have one), and a martingale collar with a leash, should we move forward.  We recycle theirs for the next dog :)  I have attached a picture of a martingale collar.  If you cannot find one, we do sell them at the daycare for 10-15.  Purchasing one from us allows us to fit it properly and it helps to benefit the rescue.  We carry leashes too, the collar and leash set are 30.  Adoption donations vary depending on the dog\u0027s age and medical expenses.  Typically they start at 650 and go up from there.  We realize this is a larger donation, however we have no state funding like shelters do.  That being said, dogs do come to you fully vetted.  They have been fixed, given distemper, bordetella, rabies, heartworm tested, de-wormed, on prevention for heartworm, fleas, ticks, intestinal parasites and microchipped.  Additionally we have paid for the microchip registration for life. \n\n*Please note we make every effort to have our dogs altered prior to adoption, if we cannot spay\/neuter clauses will be in the contract.\n\n*Please come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to meet us!\n\nThank you for choosing rescue! \n\nDon\u0027t forget to like us and follow us on Facebook, we get new animals in regularly.\n\n*Please submit an application here: http:\/\/goo.gl\/forms\/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2 and come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to see me or (315) 728-9344 or www.DogGoneInn.com or DogGoneInn@Yahoo.com or www.facebook.com\/DogGoneInn",

Nyla is looking for a home with no cats, older kids and is dog selective when sharing her home with a dog, but does not react when on a walk and seeing other dogs. She is very loyal to her person and has so much love to give. If interested please complete an application from our website.\nwww.jamesvillesecondchance.com",

This cutie\u2019s petite size and good manners make her a nice waking partner who won\u2019t pull you around. Amala is asking for a home with no other pets. She just wants a couch \u0026 some cozy blankets to snuggle on, and of course unconditional love. *Amala will be spayed before adoption.

        "description": "How Dapper does Beau look in his adorable bow tie? This sweet boy waited so proudly \u0026 patiently for his family to come. But despite the shelter\u2019s best efforts to get him home and the promise by his people to pick him up, they never showed. Now poor Beau is all dressed up with nowhere to go. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful for him to get a family who will love him unconditionally instead of abandoning him? We sure think so! Beau is around 1 1\/2 years old, loves treats and will do just about anything to get food, so he sits very nicely when asked. He also enjoys taking walks and has good leash manners, too. Beau is looking for a home with no other pets, and he deserves to be spoiled as your one and only after all he\u2019s been through. *Beau will be neutered before adoption. If you\u2019re interested in meeting this sweet boy, please send an email to bandrbunkhouse@gmail.com.",

This beautiful pup is sweet and friendly with humans, but can be a little awkward with other animals, so we\u2019re still trying to figure out if she will be able to live safely with a 4-legged friend. Marlee is around 1 year old and is deaf, so we would love to find her a family who has some experience with this. Marlee will sit for treats and is easy to walk on a leash. She will be spayed before adoption. If you\u2019re interested in meeting this sweet girl, please send an email to bandrbunkhouse@gmail.com.",

He is looking for a home with adults only and a family that has experience with larger breeds. This is because he can be a bit mouthy, but not in an aggressive way. We think it could be due to the issues with his sight. He absolutely loves the shelter staff and volunteers and we can tell he has unconditional love to give to whoever will take a chance on him. Winston enjoys going for walks and despite his size, he won\u2019t drag you around. *Winston will be neutered before adoption.* If you\u0027re interested in meeting this lovable lug, please send an email to bandrbunkhouse@gmail.com.",

He is a very sweet boy with the cutest face and beautiful eyes highlighted with perfect \u0022eyeliner\u0022. \nHis ears are velvety soft.  Nooch is an active little boy and loves playing with a doggie companion, but is equally content with being a lapdog. He is gentle, walks well on a leash, and knows \u0022sit\u0022.\nWe recommend a home with another dog because he really thrives from being around them and he doesn\u0027t like too much be left alone.\nNooch was tested with cats and although he is not aggressive he would chase the cats for sure.\nYoung and energetic is what you will get with this amazing boy.",
